I was asked to speak tonight, as a hacker and activist, concerning
the assumptions we place over online environments. But I feel i
need to start with something personal first.

Last Sunday, at the last public discussion at HAU2, the first 15
minutes were consumed by one individual that could not help himself
but demand that his concerns be heard. And while the audience booed
or begged for a more ordered discussion I realised that this person
was exposing a vulnerability that went well beyond the Wannaplay
incident. It also reminded me, with a strength that I have not felt
for a very long time, that one can never assume that their own
experiences are enough to understand the experiences of others.
Something I felt with a certain experience from my childhood.

I grew up in a religious home. At 16 years old while riding in the
car with my mother and a friend of hers I made a homophobic joke.
My parents never condoned this way of behaving but I picked this
up through my environment. Later that day my mother told me in
private that I have no idea what her friend may have gone through
in her life and no matter my beliefs that I should be aware and
treat everyone with utmost respect. This had a heavy impact on me.
So I would like to thank that individual from last week for reminding
me of this event.

Living in Berlin it is easy to assume a commonly shared understanding
of equality and freedom for the Gay community. We benefit from this,
and we celebrate it. But this beautiful city also makes it easy to
forget that just 3 weeks ago the Gay Pride parade in Belgrade was
quarantined for blocks. I witnessed the exact same scenario a few
years ago in Budapest. Our experience of equality here does not
translate outside of Berlin and many living here here may be more
aware of this than we are.

Understanding the limits of our own experience is so essential to
this topic because the virtual world lacks the physical cues and
hints that allow us to obtain common understanding and common
respect. As an example consider the cruising culture which Grindr
has largely domesticated. I am not a member of the Gay community
but I, and I'm sure many here, have had the experience of visiting
such a park. There is no Terms Of Service and no End User License
Agreement that one signs when entering. Despite this it does not
take long to adapt to the common behaviour and show the level of
respect this environment deserves. We pick this up both through
physical and unphysical cues.

The Internet lacks such cues entirely. The best we have to emulating
them are emoticons and the Emoji icon set. It is easy online,
logarithmically easier that in the physical world, to assume that
ones own understanding of a virtual community is shared by most.
This is very common and I think this can be seen in the Wannaplay
project. But this can also be seen in how we use such environments.

In august of this year someone documented, anonymously, how anyone
in the Grindr community can be physically tracked. This capability
has existed since its inception. The same issue was exposed in Tindr
in February. Tindr responded by adding a certain level of entropy,
or randomness, to the distance readings for individuals. In Tindr
you still know if someone is in your neighborhood but you will not
know who is the closest. Grindr has responded by giving their users
the option to remove accurate location readings for their profile.
However, knowing if another Grindr user is in the same building as
you is an important function utilised extensively by the community.
So by default accurate tracking remains. Despite this we still use
such services.

When we use them we sign agreements that we hardly understand. We
behave as if virtual spaces were controlled by the commons when in
fact our interaction happens instead within the private property
of corporations. And there is no Terms Of Service or End User License
Agreement that can prevent these misplaced assumptions. Assumptions
on etiquette or how we are supposed to behave with each other. But
more importantly we lack the physical tools to protect each other.
And this brings me to what I feel is one of the more import points
of discussion. That of the Internet mob and the hate directed against
the Artist, and in some cases against HAU, and I was astonished to
learn the amount of hate directed against the victim.

To explain why I find this so important we should compare how we
handle hate offline.

Berlin is still challenged with fractions of hate that reveal
themselves in sporadic moments. As residents we have become used
to attending Anti Fascist rallies when NPD or AFD would speak
publicly.  We create a buffer between the hate and the hated. Our
physical presence sends a message to the public, to the victims and
the perpetrators all at once. This action, the physicality of it,
is an essential function even when laws exist that prohibit hate
speech.

And even though many countries have enacted anti-internet-bullying
laws we still have no way to create this buffer online. For all of
human nature that the Internet has and continues to liberate this
will remain a concerning problem.

It is responsibility of everyone to be aware of this problem and
ask themselves if they are helping enable it.

The lack of physical cues to educate each other of common etiquette
online gives me a way to understand how Dries thought his project
would be received differently, as well as explain why part of the
community has responded so clearly in difference to this assumption...
It does not help me understand some of the journalists and writers
online that appear to benefit from the emancipation of hate that
is provided online. The writers that suggest that the victim responded
in a manner for personal gain are in fact they themselves the ones
whose personal gain should be examined. Because suggesting this is
only as absurd as suggesting Dries built his project with intent
to harm.
